		<h1>&nbsp;About Me&nbsp;</h1>
			<div>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zane Winders is an honors student at Purdue University Northwest, pursuing a Bachelor of 
				Science in Cybersecurity with an expected graduation in May 2028. With a distinctive background that bridges 
				technology and the performing arts, Zane brings a multifaceted perspective to the cybersecurity field.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My background as a ballet dancer and teacher has helped me develop qualities such as
				discipline, precision, and collaboration, which I now apply in my pursuit of a career in
				cybersecurity. Returning to academia at Purdue University Northwest as an Honors student
				pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity with a Minor in Organizational Leadership has
				deepened my interest in protecting digital assets in today’s connected world.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout my academic journey, I have gained practical experience through roles such
				as Media Technician, digital content manager, and leader of student organizations like ROAR
				Cyber and QuantumLeap. These experiences have improved my problem-solving abilities, taught
				me to work effectively under pressure, and strengthened my communication skills across diverse
				teams. Leading ROAR Cyber, our campus cyber defense club, has provided me with a practical
				understanding of cybersecurity principles and emphasized the importance of teamwork in
				defending against cyber threats.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My artistic background has given me a unique perspective—approaching challenges with
				creativity, resilience, and adaptability. I believe these qualities are valuable in cybersecurity,
				where innovative solutions are often necessary to address evolving threats. Participation in the
				Honors College allows me to focus fully on my studies and leadership activities, further fueling
				my interest and commitment to this field.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receiving this scholarship would support my ability to dedicate more time to my
				coursework and involvement in student organizations, helping me develop my technical skills
				and leadership abilities. I am eager to use my diverse experiences and problem-solving mindset
				to contribute to creating secure and innovative solutions that protect organizations and
				individuals.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cybersecurity is more than just a career to me; it’s about helping to secure the digital
				future. I look forward to continuing my education and making a positive impact in this dynamic
				field.</p>
